## Pirates

A Solidity smart contract for playing a game where ships can move around a grid and fire at eachother to rack up hits.

To build, use this [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) `forge` command:
```shell
$ forge build
```

If you don't have [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/), you can get it by following the [instructions here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) under the "Use Foundryup" section. Namely:
1. Run `curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash` in your terminal.
2. Run `foundryup` in your terminal.
